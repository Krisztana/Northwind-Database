# Northwind-Database

Northwind Database

It was our project on the 6th week of the Bootcamp.

It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers.

The data is available in the northwind_data folder.

The tasks were :

    to create a Postgres database
    
    to create tables in a database
    
    to write SQL queries to retrieve data
    
    to load CSV files into a database
    
    to build a dashboard
    
    to upload everything into a cloud server

create_tables : create tables in the database

analyze_nortwind : SQL queries to answer the questions

northwind_metabase : SQL queries to build the dashboard on Metabase
